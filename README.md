# Place names and personal names extractor

These scripts written by Ettore Rizza (Universit√© libre de Bruxelles) help to extract place names and personal names from user queries. Developed in the context of a large-scale case study conducted at the Royal Library of Belgium, scripts have been applied on a data set of 83,854 queries resulting from 29,812 visits (on the online historical newspapers platform BelgicaPress), over a 12-month period. 
By making use of information extraction methods, knowledge bases (KBs) and various authority files, our method aims to facilitate automated analysis of user queries' content.
